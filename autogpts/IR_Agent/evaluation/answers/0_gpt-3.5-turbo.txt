The underlying assumption of celestial phenomena in Assyrian celestial divination was that the positions and movements of celestial bodies, such as stars and planets, could influence human events and activities on Earth. Assyrian scholars believed that by observing and interpreting these celestial phenomena, they could gain insights into the future and make predictions about various aspects of life, such as wars, harvests, and the fate of individuals.
