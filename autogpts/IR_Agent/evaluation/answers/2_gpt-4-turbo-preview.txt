Babylonian astronomers were often referred to as "Chaldeans." In ancient times, the term Chaldeans came to be closely associated with people who were skilled in the sciences, particularly astronomy and astrology. Although initially, the Chaldeans were a people who lived in the southern part of Babylonia, over time, the name became synonymous with Babylonian priests and astronomers because of their advanced knowledge and contributions to early astronomy. They were renowned for their meticulous observations of celestial phenomena and their efforts to catalog and predict astronomical events, such as eclipses and the movements of the planets.
