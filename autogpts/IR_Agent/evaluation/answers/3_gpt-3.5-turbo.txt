In Babylonian astronomy, almanacs are collections of tables and texts that provide information on the positions and movements of celestial bodies, such as the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars. These almanacs were used by Babylonian astronomers to predict astronomical events and phenomena, such as eclipses and planetary conjunctions.

Normal Star almanacs, specifically, refer to a type of almanac that focuses on the positions and movements of specific fixed stars in the night sky. These almanacs would typically include data on the rising, setting, and culmination of these stars, as well as their apparent brightness and position relative to other stars. Normal Star almanacs were used by Babylonian astronomers for various purposes, such as timekeeping, navigation, and astrology.
