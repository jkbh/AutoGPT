Assyrian celestial divination and Babylonian astral science are both ancient practices that involve interpreting celestial omens for divinatory purposes. However, there are some key distinctions between the two:

1. Cultural differences: Assyrian celestial divination was primarily practiced by the Assyrians, who were a distinct people with their own unique culture and religious beliefs. Babylonian astral science, on the other hand, was practiced by the Babylonians, who had their own traditions and worldviews. These cultural differences likely influenced the way in which celestial omens were interpreted and utilized by each group.

2. Interpretation of omens: Assyrian celestial divination focused more on the interpretation of specific celestial omens, such as the appearance of comets or eclipses, to predict future events or divine the will of the gods. Babylonian astral science, on the other hand, was a more systematic and structured practice that involved studying the movements of celestial bodies, such as the planets and stars, to understand the underlying principles governing the universe.

3. Emphasis on astrology: Babylonian astral science placed a greater emphasis on astrology, the belief that the positions and movements of celestial bodies could influence human affairs and events on Earth. In contrast, Assyrian celestial divination may have been more focused on interpreting celestial omens as signs from the gods, rather than as causal factors shaping human destinies.

Overall, while both Assyrian celestial divination and Babylonian astral science involve the interpretation of celestial omens, they differ in terms of their cultural context, approach to interpreting omens, and emphasis on astrology.
