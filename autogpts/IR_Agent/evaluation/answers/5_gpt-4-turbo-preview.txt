The evidence suggesting that Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great, comes from a variety of ancient texts and historical analyses. Babylon, a key cultural and scientific hub in ancient Mesopotamia, was renowned for its advancements in astronomy. The Babylonians developed sophisticated mathematical techniques for predicting lunar, solar, and planetary phenomena, and they meticulously recorded astronomical observations on clay tablets.

Several lines of evidence suggest interactions between Babylonian astronomers and foreign rulers:

1. **Historical Records:** Ancient texts, including those from Greek and Roman sources, occasionally reference the interactions between Babylonian scholars and foreign courts. While direct mentions of astronomers serving specific foreign kings like Alexander the Great are rare, the broader historical context supports such interactions. After Alexander the Great conquered Babylon in 331 BCE, he showed a keen interest in the city's scholarly traditions. Historical accounts indicate that Alexander consulted Babylonian priests and possibly astronomers, who were highly regarded for their expertise.

2. **Astronomical Diaries:** The Babylonians kept detailed astronomical diaries, which included observations of the planets, the Moon, and the weather, as well as economic, agricultural, and political events. Some of these observations might have been of interest to foreign rulers seeking to make decisions based on celestial omens or looking to employ advanced astronomical knowledge for calendrical or navigational purposes. While the diaries themselves might not explicitly mention services rendered to foreign kings, they exemplify the type of knowledge that would have been valuable to such rulers.

3. **Cultural Exchange:** The period following Alexander's conquests saw significant cultural exchanges between the Greek and the Near Eastern worlds. Greek interest in Babylonian science, particularly in astronomy and astrology, increased. This cultural exchange suggests a framework in which Babylonian astronomers could have offered their services to foreign rulers, including Greeks, who were keen on incorporating Babylonian scientific knowledge into their own scholarly traditions.

4. **Scientific Influence:** The influence of Babylonian astronomy on subsequent Greek and Hellenistic astronomy suggests a transfer of knowledge that could have involved direct interactions between Babylonian astronomers and foreign scholars or rulers. For instance, the Babylonian sexagesimal (base-60) system was adopted by the Greeks for astronomical calculations, and later Hellenistic works exhibit clear Babylonian influences in their astronomical and astrological methods.

Although direct evidence of Babylonian astronomers serving specific foreign kings like Alexander the Great is scarce, the circumstantial evidence points towards a scenario where Babylonian astronomical expertise would have been highly esteemed and sought after by foreign rulers. This expertise, coupled with the cultural and scientific exchanges of the era, strongly suggests that Babylonian astronomers could have offered their services far beyond their homeland.
