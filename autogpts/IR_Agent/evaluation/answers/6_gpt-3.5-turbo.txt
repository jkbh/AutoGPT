The divine office, also known as the Liturgy of the Hours, is the official set of prayers and readings that Catholics and some other Christian denominations recite at specific times throughout the day. It is a way for the faithful to sanctify different parts of the day and to join in the prayer of the Church. The divine office consists of various prayer services, including Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, and Night Prayer, as well as other optional prayers such as the Office of Readings. It is traditionally prayed by priests, religious, and laity, and is considered a form of public prayer that unites the Church in prayer and worship.
