The Divine Office, also known as the Liturgy of the Hours, is the official set of prayers "marking the hours of each day and sanctifying the day with prayer" in the Roman Catholic Church. It is also observed in varying forms within some other Christian denominations, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglicanism, and Lutheranism.

The purpose of the Divine Office is to ensure the continuous prayer of the Church and to offer praise to God, commemorating the mysteries of Christ and sanctifying the day. The prayers consist primarily of Psalms supplemented by hymns, readings, and prayers. The Divine Office includes several components or "hours" traditionally prayed at specific times of the day:

1. **Office of Readings (formerly Matins)**: This can be prayed at any time and includes readings from the Bible and writings of the saints.
2. **Lauds (Morning Prayer)**: Prayed at dawn or in the early morning, focusing on praise at the start of the day.
3. **Terce (Mid-Morning Prayer), Sext (Midday Prayer), and None (Mid-Afternoon Prayer)**: These shorter hours are prayed at the third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day, respectively, and include prayers and readings appropriate to the time of day.
4. **Vespers (Evening Prayer)**: Prayed at sunset or in the early evening, offering thanks for the day.
5. **Compline (Night Prayer)**: The final prayers of the day, prayed before retiring for the night, focusing on reflection and protection during sleep.

Clergy and many religious are required to pray the Divine Office as part of their daily obligations. Many laypeople also pray the Liturgy of the Hours, either in part or in full, as a way of participating in the universal prayer of the Church and deepening their spiritual lives. The content for the Divine Office is organized in liturgical books called breviaries.
