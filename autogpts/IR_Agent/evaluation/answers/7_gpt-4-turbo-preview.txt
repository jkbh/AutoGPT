The portable breviary from San Zeno Maggiore, an important medieval manuscript, was very likely used by a high-ranking church official or member of the monastic community associated with the Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore in Verona, Italy. Given the quality and intricacy of its production, including its illumination, it suggests the user was someone of considerable importance and means, such as an abbot, bishop, or a wealthy patron closely connected to the church. The breviary, being a book containing the Divine Office for the canonical hours (the prayers to be said at the different hours of the day by members of the Catholic Church), was an indispensable tool for the personal devotion and liturgical duties of clerics, making its association with a figure of authority within the church all the more plausible. Without specific provenance details or ownership marks that directly identify the original owner, the exact identity of the user remains a matter of scholarly inference based on the context of its creation and use.
