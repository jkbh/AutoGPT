The performative distinction between chants and readings in the breviary is maintained through several key elements:

1. Chants are typically sung or recited in a melodic and rhythmic manner, often using specific musical notation and following a prescribed order of tones and pitches. This helps to distinguish them from the spoken readings which are typically recited in a more straightforward manner.

2. Chants are often accompanied by specific gestures, such as making the sign of the cross or bowing at certain points in the text. These physical actions help to enhance the performative aspect of the chant and distinguish it from the readings which typically do not involve such physical gestures.

3. Chants are often repeated multiple times throughout the breviary, either daily or on specific feast days, creating a sense of familiarity and ritual. Readings, on the other hand, are typically read aloud only once, adding to their distinctiveness from the chants.

Overall, the combination of musicality, gestures, and repetition helps to maintain the performative distinction between chants and readings in the breviary, allowing worshippers to engage with the texts in different ways and contribute to the overall worship experience.
