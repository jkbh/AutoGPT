In the context of the liturgical breviary used primarily within Christian traditions, especially in Catholicism, chants and readings are two distinct elements contributing uniquely to the structure and execution of liturgical hours or divine office. The breviary is the book that contains all the texts necessary for the celebration of these liturgical hours, including psalms, hymns, readings, and prayers. The distinction between chants and readings in the breviary is maintained through several means, including tradition, notational differences, purpose, and the manner of execution. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. **Tradition and Liturgical Rules**: The historical and theological traditions of the Church play a significant role in distinguishing between what is chanted and what is read. Liturgical rules, which may vary among different Christian traditions (e.g., Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican), provide guidelines on the parts of the office that are to be sung or chanted and those that are to be read. For example, the Invitatory, Psalms, Canticles, and Responses are typically chanted, while Readings (lessons), Short Readings (from Scripture), and some prayers might be read, though there is flexibility depending on the specific liturgical context and the solemnity of the occasion.

2. **Notational Differences**: In many liturgical books, including breviaries, different notations can indicate whether a text is meant to be chanted or read. Chants, especially Gregorian chants, have their specific neumes (a form of musical notation) that guide the melody and rhythm of the chant. On the other hand, readings are typically written in plain text without musical notation, indicating that they are to be read aloud, not sung.

3. **Purpose and Function**: The liturgical function of the text often dictates whether it is chanted or read. Chants are often used for psalms, hymns, and responses, aiming to elevate the worship experience, facilitate meditation, and enhance the communal aspect of the liturgy. Readings, which primarily consist of larger portions of Scripture, homilies, or writings of Church Fathers, serve a didactic purpose, aiming to instruct and inspire the faithful through direct, clear delivery.

4. **Execution and Participation**: The practical aspect of how chants and readings are executed also maintains their distinction. Chants are typically performed with a specific tone, melody, and rhythm and may involve antiphonal singing between a cantor/choir and the congregation or between two groups. Readings, however, are proclaimed in a speaking voice, focusing on clarity and audibility to ensure that the congregation can understand the scriptural passages or teachings.

5. **Musical Setting and Environment**: The musical setting and the acoustics of the environment can also influence the performative distinction. Chants are often supported by acoustics that enhance their musical and meditative quality, while readings might be delivered in a manner that prioritizes intelligibility over musicality.

In conclusion, the distinction between chants and readings in the breviary is maintained through a combination of liturgical tradition, notational indications, the intrinsic purpose of the texts, and the manner of their execution, all of which contribute to the rich tapestry of the liturgical experience.
