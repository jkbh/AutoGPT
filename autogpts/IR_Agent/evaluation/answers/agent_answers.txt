The underlying assumption of celestial phenomena in Assyrian celestial divination is the extensive engagement with performative rituals, observations, and interpretation of the performance, as revealed in Assyrian letters and reports. This contrasts with Babylonian astronomical diaries that do not explain the performance per se, but rather focus on predictions and observations <id> Document 2 </id>.
I'm sorry, but the term 'qersu' is not mentioned in the provided context documents. <?>
Babylonian astronomers were called astronomers. <1>
In Babylonian astronomy, 'almanacs' refer to documents that contain predictions and observations. 'Normal Star almanacs' likely refer to specific types of almanacs that focus on standard stars and their positions in the sky. (Document 2) <id>
Assyrian celestial divination distinguishes itself from Babylonian astral science through the details revealed in Assyrian letters and reports about the preparation, recording, performative rituals, observations, and interpretation of the performance, which are not explained in Babylonian astronomical diaries.<id1>
Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great, as suggested by Babylonian sources that have preserved information about their preparation and recording of performances and sometimes include predictions and observations. The performance per se is not explained in astronomical diaries produced by Babylonian astronomers. Contrary to Assyrian letters and reports revealing a great deal of information about performative rituals, observations, and interpretation of the performance. The two types of sources are compared in terms of their underlying similarities. However, the author also points out their differences in terms of how the performance was prepared and recorded and in terms of their performative processes. <id>
The divine office refers to a structured series of liturgical prayers and readings that are performed daily at various times by members of the clergy or monastic communities. It is a key component of the religious rituals followed in churches and monasteries. <2>
The user of the portable breviary from San Zeno Maggiore was likely the abbot for personal use rather than for the monastic community's collective ritual practices. <id:1>
The performative distinction between chants and readings in the breviary is maintained through musical notation, recitation marks, and vocalisation aids instructing the performer on what words to use and how to pronounce, chant, or sing them. Manuscripts for complex performances provide a structure for different readings and actions by ordering their contents or paratextual elements accordingly. Reading linear texts aloud from manuscripts is a significant method for performance tools, though not the only way manuscripts are utilized for performance purposes.<Document 2>
