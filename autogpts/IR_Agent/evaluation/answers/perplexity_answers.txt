The underlying assumption of celestial phenomena in Assyrian celestial divination was that the gods produced signs to communicate with mankind. This belief formed the basis of Mesopotamian divination, where it was thought that celestial events were a means through which divine intentions were revealed to humans.
A 'qersu' is a type of coffin characterized by a rectangular four-poster outer coffin with a vaulted lid, typical of the 25th/26th dynasty (Late Period) in ancient Egypt. These coffins usually consist of an outer qersu coffin, along with one or more anthropoid coffins inside, one of which may be a cartonnage mummy case. The word 'qersu' is usually written with a hieroglyph of a coffin with a rounded top and was commonly used around 750 BC during a return to burial customs involving exterior coffins shaped like boxes that housed anthropoid coffins or mummy-cases containing the deceased.
Babylonian astronomers were frequently referred to as Chaldeans in classical Greek and Latin sources. They were considered as priest-scribes who specialized in astrology and various forms of divination.
In Babylonian astronomy, almanacs were detailed listings predicting celestial events and planetary movements, while Normal Star almanacs specifically focused on reference stars for tracking planetary positions. These tools were essential for Babylonian astronomers to observe and interpret astronomical phenomena accurately.
Assyrian celestial divination is distinguished from Babylonian astral science by the performative aspects. While Babylonian sources focus on observation and prediction, revealing little about their performance, Assyrian sources shed light on the performative elements of celestial divination. This distinction highlights how Assyrian practices involved more explicit elements of performance compared to the Babylonian approach.
Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great, as evidenced by the presence of Alexander the Great in Babylon in 331 and 323 BC. Babylonian texts, such as fragments of astronomical diaries and the "Dynastic Prophecy," which is a precursor of prophecies like those in Daniel 11, highlight the impact of Babylonian wisdom (astronomy, astrology, and divination) on Alexander's decisions. Additionally, Greek and Babylonian evidence reveals that temples in Hellenistic Babylon continued to function during this period, with 18 temples being attested as operational. This historical context showcases the interaction between Babylonian scholars and foreign rulers like Alexander the Great, indicating a willingness on the part of Babylonian astronomers to provide their expertise and services to influential leaders.
The Divine Office, also known as the Liturgy of the Hours, is a set of Catholic prayers that mark the hours of each day with prayer. It consists of various canonical hours and is considered the official set of prayers of the Catholic Church. The Divine Office includes selections from the Psalms, scriptural proclamations, Gospel canticles, intercessions, hymns, and readings from the Bible and spiritual writers. It is a meditative dialogue on the mystery of Christ and serves to sanctify the day with prayer. The Divine Office is a significant part of the liturgical tradition in both Eastern and Western Christianity, emphasizing communal prayer and connecting the sacrifice of praise to the Eucharist.
The portable breviary from San Zeno Maggiore was likely used by a member of the late-fifteenth-century manuscript from the abbey of San Zeno Maggiore in Verona, Kremsm√ºnster, Stiftsbibliothek, CC60
Therefore, in summary, the performative distinction between chants (hymns) and readings (lessons, little chapters) in the Breviary is maintained through a structured arrangement of elements like hymns, readings, and prayers that follow a specific order and serve distinct purposes within this liturgical book.
