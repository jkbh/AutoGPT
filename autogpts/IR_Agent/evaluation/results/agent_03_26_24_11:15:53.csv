5,"What suggests that Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great?","In spite of a lack of textual evidence, it is generally assumed that celestial divination was practised at the Babylonian court after the fall of Niniveh (in 611 BCE), which suggests that at least some of those who compiled astronomical diaries were engaged in these activities.

8,How is the performative distinction between chants and readings maintained in the breviary?,"The performative distinction between chants and readings typical of the earlier Rollenbücher is maintained graphically in these later books for private use, and with it the liturgical-communal performance of the Divine Office is emulated.","The performative distinction between chants and readings in the breviary is maintained through musical notation, recitation marks, and vocalisation aids instructing the performer on what words to use and how to pronounce, chant, or sing them. Manuscripts for complex performances provide a structure for different readings and actions by ordering their contents or paratextual elements accordingly. Reading linear texts aloud from manuscripts is a significant method for performance tools, though not the only way manuscripts are utilized for performance purposes.<Document 2>",0.28987201148556896
