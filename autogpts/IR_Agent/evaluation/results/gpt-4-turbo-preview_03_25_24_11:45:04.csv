0,What was the underlying assumption of celestial phenomena in Assyrian celestial divination?,Underlying this practice was the assumption that celestial phenomena are a form of ‘heavenly writing’ in which the gods reveal their decisions about future events.,"The underlying assumption of celestial phenomena in Assyrian celestial divination was that occurrences in the heavens (such as lunar and solar eclipses, planetary movements, and other astronomical events) were direct manifestations of the gods' will and intentions. The Assyrians believed that these celestial events were signs that could indicate future outcomes on Earth, affecting everything from the fate of the king and the empire to weather conditions and military success.



Celestial divination in Assyria, part of a broader Mesopotamian tradition, held that the gods communicated with humans through the patterns and events in the sky, considering the heavens as a writing board for divine messages. Therefore, by observing and interpreting these signs accurately, priests and diviners could gain insight into the gods' plans and advise the rulers accordingly to avoid misfortune or to make decisions that were in harmony with divine will.



This belief in the significance of celestial phenomena was deeply integrated into Assyrian religion, governance, and daily life, leading to the development of a sophisticated system of astronomy and astrological interpretation. The meticulous observations and records kept by Mesopotamian scholars over centuries laid important foundations for the later development of astronomy.",0.32160168733959393
