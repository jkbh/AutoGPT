4,What distinguishes Assyrian celestial divination from Babylonian astral science?,"A comparison between the Assyrian and Babylonian sources discussed above reveals some notable differences. For one thing, prediction played an insignificant role in Assyrian celestial divination compared to Babylonian astral science.","Assyrian celestial divination is distinguished from Babylonian astral science by the performative aspects.

5,"What suggests that Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great?","In spite of a lack of textual evidence, it is generally assumed that celestial divination was practised at the Babylonian court after the fall of Niniveh (in 611 BCE), which suggests that at least some of those who compiled astronomical diaries were engaged in these activities. Even after the Persian conquest of Babylonia in 539 BCE, when native Mesopotamian kingship disappeared, Babylonian astronomers are said to have offered their services to their foreign kings, including Alexander the Great.44","Babylonian astronomers offered their services to foreign kings, including Alexander the Great, as evidenced by the presence of Alexander the Great in Babylon in 331 and 323 BC. Babylonian texts, such as fragments of astronomical diaries and the ""Dynastic Prophecy,"" which is a precursor of prophecies like those in Daniel 11, highlight the impact of Babylonian wisdom (astronomy, astrology, and divination) on Alexander's decisions. Additionally, Greek and Babylonian evidence reveals that temples in Hellenistic Babylon continued to function during this period, with 18 temples being attested as operational. This historical context showcases the interaction between Babylonian scholars and foreign rulers like Alexander the Great, indicating a willingness on the part of Babylonian astronomers to provide their expertise and services to influential leaders.

8,How is the performative distinction between chants and readings maintained in the breviary?,"The performative distinction between chants and readings typical of the earlier Rollenbücher is maintained graphically in these later books for private use, and with it the liturgical-communal performance of the Divine Office is emulated.","Therefore, in summary, the performative distinction between chants (hymns) and readings (lessons, little chapters) in the Breviary is maintained through a structured arrangement of elements like hymns, readings, and prayers that follow a specific order and serve distinct purposes within this liturgical book.",0.34323523001268164
